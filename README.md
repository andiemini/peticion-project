Peticion PHP Project 
This is a school project I did during my 3rd year, the base of the project was to turn a HTML static website into a functional one that would also be helpful towards society in some way and by that I choose to make a petition based website.
You can check the website by uploading the SQL on a database in PHP(phpmyadmin).
